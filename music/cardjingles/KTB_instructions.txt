1. Put the entire "ctmystery" folder in AddMusicK's "samples" folder.
2. Place the "ctmystery.txt" file anywhere within AddMusicK's "music" folder, and paste the directory to the TXT file in Addmusic_list.txt, along with the hex ID that you want the song to have in the ROM.
3. Run AddMusicK, and type your ROM's file name (the ROM file must be present in the AMK directory).
